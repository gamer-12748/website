# to see how to launch read start.md

.env file keeps the source code hidden in the browser

.gitignore ignores all resources we want ignored

yarn.lock is there idk why, don't care. i think it has something to do with yarn start, but to lazy to google.

you can leave other file's. license to code is presnt in license.txt

you can read what each file in src and public does, by opening the file.
